# Scripts for magicblogs.de

## add_scryfall_links.user.js

Magicblogs.de uses a WordPress plugin to show images for the cards mentioned in the text.
When an article is about a new set, the new cards are not found yet and an image of the default card back is shown
instead.

This script appends a link to the Scryfall search to each card (CSS class "jTip") where new cards are available much
earlier.
