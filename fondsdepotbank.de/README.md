# depotbestand_relative_performance.user.js

The detail view for your depot shows the absolute plus the relative performance per year and weighted by capital ("
kapitalgewichtete Performance), both for the depot in total and each item in it.

This script will add the total relative performance for the depot and each item, i.e. profit/loss divided by cost value.
